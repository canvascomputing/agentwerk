## Vision

> agentwerk makes agents as simple as function calls. Build one in a few lines, call it, get a result — yet behind that surface, the same agent can run shell commands, search the web, read files, or orchestrate a fleet of sub-agents. The API stays small; the capabilities don't.

## Design philosophy

1. **Library, not framework.** agentwerk provides building blocks — you compose them in your own application. No runtime to boot, no traits to implement to get started, no opinions about how you structure your code.
2. **Minimal by design.** Few dependencies, no transport abstractions, no plugin registries. Every abstraction must earn its place by removing real complexity, not by adding indirection.
3. **Composable.** Clone a template, tweak one field, run it. This is how you get from one agent to a pool of fifty — no registration, no global state.
4. **Provider-agnostic.** The same agent code works across Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral. Swap one line, keep everything else.
5. **Observe, don't prescribe.** The execution loop emits events. The caller decides what to do with them — log, stream, ignore. No built-in UI, no forced logging.
6. **Correctness over convenience.** Zero warnings. Schema validation with retries. Typed errors. No silent fallbacks.

## Build and test

```bash
make          # build (warnings are errors)
make test              # run unit tests (warnings are errors)
make test_integration  # run integration tests (requires LLM provider)
make fmt      # format code
make clean    # clean build artifacts
make bump              # bump patch version (part=minor or part=major)
make publish           # publish to crates.io (runs tests first)
```

All code must compile with zero warnings (`RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"`).

Integration tests are in `crates/agentwerk/tests/`. Shared helpers (provider setup, event handler, JSON output) are in `tests/common/mod.rs`. Run with `make test_integration`.
Use cases are in `crates/use-cases/src/cli/`. Run with `make use_case name=<name>`.

## Key conventions

- **No new dependencies without asking.** The crate is intentionally minimal (tokio, serde, serde_json, libc, reqwest, futures-util). Providers own a `reqwest::Client` directly — no transport abstraction.
- **No ad-hoc changes to critical types without a plan.** These types form the public API and are used across the entire codebase: `Agent`, `ToolContext`, `Event`, `Tool` trait, `CompletionRequest`, `AgentOutput`, `AgentPool`. Propose changes in a plan first.
- **Tools capture dependencies at construction time** via closures or struct fields. The internal `ToolContext` handles (`runtime: Arc<Runtime>`, `caller_spec: Arc<AgentSpec>`) exist solely for the agent loop to give `SpawnAgentTool` / `ToolSearchTool` read access to loop state — do not use them for new tools.
- **`tools/tool.rs` vs `tools/`**: `tool.rs` defines the trait and infrastructure (Tool, ToolRegistry, ToolBuilder, execute_tool_calls). Other files in `tools/` are concrete implementations.
- **`agent/` vs `provider/` vs `persistence/`**: `agent/` contains the agent definition (`Agent`), execution loop (`Runtime` / `AgentSpec` / `LoopState` / `run_loop`), events, output, and prompts. `provider/` contains LLM communication and estimated costs. `persistence/` contains internal disk storage (session transcripts, tasks).
- **`_file` variants**: All prompt builder methods (`identity_prompt`, `instruction_prompt`, `behavior_prompt`, `context_prompt`) and `output_schema` have `_file` counterparts (e.g. `identity_prompt_file(path)`, `output_schema_file(path)`) that load content from disk. File-read errors are collected on the `Agent` and surfaced when `run()` is called.
- **Tests live inline** in each module as `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. Use `MockProvider` and `TestHarness` from `testutil.rs`.

## Naming conventions

- **Builder methods**: bare nouns or compound nouns. No `with_` prefix.
  Exception: when the method name clashes with a trait method (e.g. `with_description` on BashTool).
  Examples: `.name()`, `.model()`, `.tool()`, `.sub_agents()`, `.read_only()`.
- **Constructors**: `new()` for the primary/simple constructor. `with_client()` for custom-client variants. Named constructors for semantics: `open()`, `unrestricted()`, `success()`, `error()`, `empty()`.
- **Getters/setters on mutable refs**: `set_`/`get_` prefix to distinguish from builder methods.
  Example: `set_extension()`, `get_extension()`.
- **Free functions**: snake_case. Example: `execute_tool_calls()`, `prewarm_connection()`.
- **Tool structs**: `{Name}Tool`. Example: `ReadFileTool`, `BashTool`, `SpawnAgentTool`.

## README conventions

The README is the public face of the library. Keep it terse, example-driven, and scannable.

- **Section order is fixed**: Installation → Quick Start → Use Cases → API → Development. Each top-level section maps to a TOC link in the centered header.
- **Code before prose.** Lead every subsection with a minimal working example, then explain. A one-sentence intro is enough — don't over-narrate.
- **Tables for enumerations.** Use tables to list methods, events, built-in tools, guardrails, env variables, and inheritance rules. Prefer a table over a bulleted list whenever items share the same shape (name + description, or method + default + effect).
- **Shape tables with grouping columns.** When entries cluster (Agent / LLM Provider / Tool Usage for events; File / Search / Shell / Web / Utility for tools), use a leading empty-header column with bold group labels spanning multiple rows.
- **Use `>` blockquotes for callouts** — tips, prerequisites, cross-references. Example: `> Consider configuring your LLM provider (see [Environment](#environment)).`
- **Use cases show real output.** Every entry in Use Cases includes the invocation (`make use_case ...`) and a realistic JSON output block. No placeholder results.
- **Cross-link, don't repeat.** Reference the Environment section from anywhere that mentions provider setup; reference Inheritance when discussing sub-agents. Keep each fact in one place.
- **Headers**: `#` title, `##` top-level (Installation, API, Development), `###` features (Agent, Prompting, Sub-agents, Guardrails, AgentPool, Tools), `####` nested topics (Inheritance).
- **Voice**: direct, imperative, no marketing. "Give your agent access to simple tools" — not "empower your application with…". Keep the one-sentence tagline style ("A minimal Rust crate that…").
- **Keep examples minimal.** Show the smallest snippet that demonstrates the feature. Elide unrelated setup with `...` or obvious imports. Use `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` / `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` as example models to stay consistent.
- **Update triggers**: a new builder method, a new tool, a new event kind, a new env variable, or a changed default all require a README edit in the matching table. Structural/internal changes do not.
