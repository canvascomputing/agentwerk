---

## Installation

```bash
cargo add agentwerk
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use agentwerk::tools::ReadFileTool;
use agentwerk::Agent;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let work = Agent::new()
        .from_env()
        .role("You are a Rust developer who reads source files to answer questions.")
        .tool(ReadFileTool)
        .task("What does Cargo.toml describe?")
        .finish()
        .await;

    let answer = work.last_result().unwrap();
    println!("{answer}");
}
```

## Use Cases

Example projects built with agentwerk:

- [Terminal REPL](crates/use-cases/src/terminal_repl/): minimal interactive chat
- [Divide and Conquer](crates/use-cases/src/divide_and_conquer/): arithmetic problem shared across agents
- [Deep Research](crates/use-cases/src/deep_research/): deep research pipeline (requires `BRAVE_API_KEY`)
- [Malware Scanner](crates/use-cases/src/malware_scanner/): identify indicators of compromise in a software package

> Configure an LLM provider first (see [Environment](#environment)).

```bash
make use_case                # list available names
make use_case name=<name>    # run one
```

## Agents

An `Agent` picks up **tickets**, uses assigned tools to solve them, and writes the result back onto each ticket.

```rust
use agentwerk::tools::ReadFileTool;

let agent = Agent::new()
    .name("worker_0")
    .label("math")
    .tool(ReadFileTool)
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `name(s)` | Set an identifier for assigning tickets. |
| `label(l)` / `labels([..])` | Restrict the agent to tickets carrying matching labels. |
| `tool(t)` / `tools([..])` | Register a tool the agent may call. |
| `dir(p)` | Set the directory accessible for tool calls. |

### Providers

A `Provider` connects the agent to an LLM service. agentwerk ships providers for Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, and a LiteLLM proxy.

```rust
use agentwerk::providers::AnthropicProvider;

let agent = Agent::new()
    .provider(AnthropicProvider::new(key))
    .model("claude-sonnet-4-20250514");

// Or pick from environment variables (see Environment).
let agent = Agent::new().from_env();
```

Each provider exposes `.base_url(url)` and `.timeout(duration)` to override the endpoint and request timeout.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `provider(p)` | Set the LLM provider. |
| `provider_from_env()` | Detect the provider from environment variables. |
| `model(m)` | Set the model the provider runs. |
| `model_from_env()` | Read the model name from environment variables. |
| `from_env()` | Detect provider and model in one call. |

### Models

`.model(m)` accepts a model name or a `Model`. Names registered with a known provider resolve to a context window automatically. For private or proxied models, build a `Model` and pass an explicit window so automatic compaction stays active:

```rust
use agentwerk::providers::Model;

let agent = Agent::new()
    .model(Model::from_name("my-local-model").context_window(128_000));
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Model::from_name(name)` | Look the model up in each provider's registry. |
| `context_window(size)` | Set an explicit context window in tokens. |

## Tickets

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canvascomputing/agentwerk/main/tickets.jpg" width="400" />
</p>

The `TicketSystem` is the core data structure of agentwerk to orchestrate complex collaboration between agents. A `task` is the work itself, a `ticket` wraps it with additional metadata, like labels and schemas. Labels route work to matching agents.

```rust
use agentwerk::{Agent, Ticket, TicketSystem};
use agentwerk::tools::FetchUrlTool;

let tickets = TicketSystem::new();

tickets.pool(4, |i| {
    Agent::new()
        .name(format!("researcher_{i}"))
        .label("research")
        .from_env()
        .tool(FetchUrlTool)
});

tickets.agent(
    Agent::new()
        .name("analyst")
        .label("analysis")
        .from_env()
);

for url in pricing_pages {
    tickets.task_labeled(
        format!("Fetch {url} and extract pricing tiers, limits, and features."),
        "research",
    );
}

tickets.ticket(
    Ticket::new("Rank all products by value for a 10-person engineering team.")
        .label("analysis")
        .schema(comparison_schema)
);
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `agent(agent)` | Add an agent to this ticket system. |
| `pool(n, build)` | Add `n` agents built by `build(i)`, where `i` is the 0-based agent index. |
| `dir(d)` | Set the directory where knowledge, results, and ticket logs are persisted. |
| `task(t)` | Submit a task and return its ticket key. |
| `task_labeled(t, l)` | Submit a task tagged with `l` for label-scoped routing. |
| `ticket(t)` | Submit a `Ticket` with custom labels, a schema, or a parent link. |
| `comment(key, c)` | Add a comment to an existing ticket. |

### Execution

Start, wait, and cancel a run:

```rust
tickets.start();
tickets.finish().await;
let answer = tickets.last_result();
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `start()` | Begin processing tickets in the background. |
| `finish().await` | Process every queued ticket and return. |
| `cancel()` | Cancel the run from anywhere: async code, ctrl-c handlers, drop guards. |
| `cancel_on_ctrl_c()` | Cancel the run on the first ctrl-c. |

### Reading results

Query the system after `finish().await` returns:

```rust
tickets.finish().await;

if let Some(answer) = tickets.last_result() {
    println!("{answer}");
}

for ticket in tickets.tickets() {
    println!("{}: {}", ticket.key(), ticket.status());
}
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `last_result()` | Return the most recent finished ticket's payload as a string. |
| `all_results()` | Return every finished ticket's payload as a string. |
| `tickets()` | Return every ticket in creation order, with status, payload, and metadata. |
| `get(key)` | Return the ticket at `key`, or `None` when it is unknown. |
| `first()` | Return the earliest ticket by creation time. |
| `search(query)` | Return tickets whose task body contains `query`, case-insensitively. |
| `filter(predicate)` | Return tickets matching the predicate, in creation order. |
| `find(predicate)` | Return the earliest ticket matching the predicate. |
| `count(predicate)` | Return the count of tickets matching the predicate. |
| `is_cancelled()` | Return `true` once a cancel has been requested. |

### Inspecting tickets

Each `Ticket` carries the recorded result, its transcript, and lifecycle timestamps. Deserialize structured results directly into a type:

```rust
#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Report { title: String }

let ticket = tickets.find(|t| t.has_label("analysis")).unwrap();
let report: Report = ticket.result_as().unwrap();
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `key()` | Return the ticket's stable identifier. |
| `status()` | Return the lifecycle status as a lowercase string. |
| `result()` | Return the raw JSON result payload. |
| `result_string()` | Return the result payload as a string. |
| `result_as::<R>()` | Return the result deserialized into `R`. |
| `comments()` | Return the transcript of messages exchanged with the model. |
| `has_label(label)` | Return `true` when the ticket carries `label`. |
| `parent_key()` | Return the parent ticket's key when one was set. |
| `created_at()` | Return the millisecond timestamp at which the ticket was created. |
| `started_at()` | Return the millisecond timestamp at which an agent claimed the ticket. |
| `finished_at()` | Return the millisecond timestamp at which the ticket was marked finished. |
| `failed_at()` | Return the millisecond timestamp at which the ticket failed. |
| `elapsed()` | Return the creation-to-terminal duration once the ticket is done or failed. |

### Policies

Configure execution policies on a ticket system. A breach fires `EventKind::PolicyViolated` and halts execution.

```rust
let tickets = TicketSystem::new();
tickets
    .max_turns(40)
    .max_time(std::time::Duration::from_secs(300))
    .max_input_tokens(200_000)
    .max_output_tokens(50_000)
    .max_request_tokens(8_000)
    .max_schema_retries(3)
    .max_request_retries(3)
    .request_retry_delay(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500));
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `max_turns(n)` | Cap the total number of turns. |
| `max_time(d)` | Cap the total elapsed duration. |
| `max_input_tokens(n)` | Cap the total input tokens. |
| `max_output_tokens(n)` | Cap the total output tokens. |
| `max_request_tokens(n)` | Cap the input tokens per request. |
| `max_schema_retries(n)` | Cap the schema-validation retry attempts. |
| `max_request_retries(n)` | Cap the retry attempts on recoverable provider errors. |
| `request_retry_delay(d)` | Set the base delay between request retries. |

## Prompting

Every prompt has three parts: `role` (who the agent is), `context` (the situation it operates in), and `task` (work it should perform). The structure follows the [prompting guide](https://github.com/canvascomputing/prompting).

```rust
let agent = Agent::new()
    .role("You are an arithmetic worker. Compute step by step and show your work.")
    .context("- Stage 2 of a math-tutor pipeline.\n- Attempts remaining: 2.")
    .task("Compute (47 * 92) / {divisor}, then round to the nearest integer.")
    .template_variable("divisor", "8");
```

When `context(...)` is not set, agentwerk supplies a default block:

```markdown
- Working directory: /Users/caro
- Platform: darwin
- OS version: 25.1.0
- Date: 2026-05-06
- Turns remaining: 8
- Input tokens remaining: 95000
- Output tokens remaining: 12000
- Time remaining: 240s
```

## Tools

Give agents access to tools helping them to solve a given task. Each tool exposes an action the agent can choose to take. agentwerk provides minimal baseline tools:

| | Tool | Description |
|-|------|-------------|
| **File** | `ReadFileTool` | Read a file with line numbers, offset, and limit. |
| | `WriteFileTool` | Create or overwrite a file. |
| | `EditFileTool` | Replace text in a file. |
| **Search** | `GlobTool` | Find files by pattern. |
| | `GrepTool` | Search file contents. |
| | `ListDirectoryTool` | List files and directories. |
| **Shell** | `BashTool` | Run a shell command matching an allowed pattern. |
| **Web** | `FetchUrlTool` | Fetch a URL and read its body. |
| **Tickets** | `FinishTicketTool` | Write the result for the current ticket and mark it finished. |
| | `HandoverTicketTool` | Write the result, mark the ticket finished, and hand follow-up work to another agent. |
| | `ManageTicketsTool` | Read the ticket queue and create or edit tickets. |
| | `ReadTicketsTool` | Read the ticket queue. |
| **Knowledge** | `ManageKnowledgeTool` | Write, read, remove, or list pages in the agent's knowledge store. |
| **Discovery** | `FindToolsTool` | Discover tools registered with `Tool::defer(true)`. |

### Bash

`BashTool` restricts execution to commands matching a glob pattern. The first argument names the tool the model sees; the second is the allowed pattern.

```rust
use agentwerk::tools::BashTool;

let agent = Agent::new()
    .tool(BashTool::new("git", "git *"))
    .tool(BashTool::unrestricted());
```

`BashTool::unrestricted()` removes the pattern check.

### Custom tools

Define custom tools for specific needs. Each tool declares a JSON-Schema for its inputs:

```rust
use agentwerk::tools::{Tool, ToolResult};
use serde_json::json;

let greet = Tool::new("greet", "Say hello")
    .schema(json!({
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "name": { "type": "string" } },
        "required": ["name"]
    }))
    .read_only(true)
    .handler(|input, _ctx| async move {
        let name = input["name"].as_str().unwrap_or("world");
        Ok(ToolResult::success(format!("Hello, {name}!")))
    });
```

`.read_only(true)` allows the agent to run a tool concurrently with other read-only calls in the same turn.

## Knowledge

A `Knowledge` store is the agent's long-term memory. It is written to disk, can be shared across multiple agents, and is curated by the agent through `ManageKnowledgeTool`.

Each entry is stored as a markdown page on disk; a compact index of one-line summaries is injected into the system prompt so the agent can decide which pages to read.

```rust
use agentwerk::Knowledge;

// Open a store and share it across agents:
let store = Knowledge::load("./.agentwerk")?;
let alice = Agent::new().knowledge(&store);
let bob = Agent::new().knowledge(&store);

// Raise the rendered-index char budget (default 4000):
let store = Knowledge::load("./.agentwerk")?.index_char_limit(12_000);
let agent = Agent::new().knowledge(&store);
```

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `knowledge(&store)` | Bind a shared knowledge store to the agent. |

## Schemas

A `Schema` constrains the result an agent must produce for a ticket. A violation triggers a retry until `max_schema_retries` is exhausted.

```rust
use agentwerk::schemas::Schema;
use agentwerk::Ticket;

let schema = Schema::parse(json!({
    "type": "object",
    "properties": { "title": { "type": "string" } },
    "required": ["title"]
}))?;

tickets.ticket(Ticket::new("Write a report.").schema(schema));
```

## Compaction

When an agent's conversation grows close to the model's context window, agentwerk summarizes the older portion of the history and continues with the compacted version. Compaction runs automatically; no configuration is required.

Two seams trigger it:

| Trigger | When |
|---------|------|
| Proactive | Before each request, when the estimated input tokens cross `context_window - 20K (output reserve) - 13K (headroom)`. |
| Reactive | After the provider rejects a request as too large or flags the response with context-window overflow. |

In both cases the agent keeps the leading context and task messages, drops the rest, and replaces them with one summary message generated by a no-tools provider call. Each attempt emits `CompactionStarted` and either `CompactionFinished` (success) or `CompactionFailed` (the summarization call returned a provider error), so observers can see the lifecycle.

If a request still exceeds the window after one compaction, the ticket fails with `RequestFailed`.

## Resumption

`TicketSystem::load(dir)` restores a ticket system from disk for session resumption.

```rust
let tickets = TicketSystem::load(".agentwerk")?;

tickets.agent(my_agent);
tickets.start();
```

## Events

Events report everything that happens while your agents work and give you deep insights into behavior or failures.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use agentwerk::event::{Event, EventKind};

let agent = Agent::new()
    .event_handler(Arc::new(|event: Event| {
        if let EventKind::TicketFinished { key } = &event.kind {
            eprintln!("[{}] done {key}", event.agent_name);
        }
    }));
```

| | Kind | Description |
|-|------|-------------|
| **Ticket** | `TicketStarted` | An agent claimed a ticket. |
| | `TicketFinished` | A ticket finished successfully. |
| | `TicketFailed` | A ticket failed. |
| **Provider** | `RequestStarted` | A provider request started. |
| | `RequestFinished` | A provider request finished and reported its token usage. |
| | `RequestFailed` | A provider request failed and stopped the ticket. |
| | `RequestRetried` | A transient provider error triggered a retry. |
| | `TextChunkReceived` | A streamed text chunk arrived. |
| **Tool** | `ToolCallStarted` | A tool invocation started. |
| | `ToolCallFinished` | A tool invocation finished. |
| | `ToolCallFailed` | A tool invocation failed but the ticket continues. |
| | `SchemaRetried` | A schema validation failed and the model was re-prompted. |
| **Compaction** | `CompactionStarted` | Compaction is about to summarize the conversation tail. |
| | `CompactionFinished` | Compaction finished and replaced the tail with a summary. |
| | `CompactionFailed` | The summarization call failed; the ticket is about to fail. |
| | `BlockingLimitExceeded` | The next-request token estimate crossed the compaction threshold. |
| **Run** | `PolicyViolated` | A policy limit was breached and execution stopped. |

## Stats

`Stats` contain metrics about the progress of your agents' work, allowing to optimize your agentic system and identify bottlenecks.

```rust
let s = tickets.stats();
let scan = s.stats_for_label("scan");
```

| | Method | Description |
|-|--------|-------------|
| **Run** | `run_duration()` | Return the run's elapsed duration, live while agents work and frozen once the loop finishes. `None` until the first ticket starts. |
| **Work** | `work_duration()` | Return the sum of every finished ticket's start-to-end span. |
| | `avg_work_duration()` | Return the mean of the same span, or `None` until a ticket finishes. |
| **Tickets** | `tickets_created()` | Return the count of tickets created. |
| | `tickets_finished()` | Return the count of tickets that finished successfully. |
| | `tickets_failed()` | Return the count of tickets that failed. |
| | `tickets_success_rate()` | Return `done / (done + failed)`, or `None` until a ticket finishes. |
| | `ticket_duration()` | Return the sum of every finished ticket's creation-to-end span. |
| | `avg_ticket_duration()` | Return the mean of the same span, or `None` until a ticket finishes. |
| **Tokens** | `input_tokens()` | Return the total input tokens across all provider responses. |
| | `output_tokens()` | Return the total output tokens across all provider responses. |
| **Activity** | `turns()` | Return the count of times an agent picked up a ticket to process. |
| | `requests()` | Return the total provider responses received. |
| | `tool_calls()` | Return the total tool calls. |
| | `errors()` | Return the total provider errors. |
| **Labels** | `stats_for_label(label)` | Return a nested `Stats` slice scoped to tickets carrying `label`. |

# Development

## Workspace

- `crates/agentwerk/`: the library.
- `crates/use-cases/`: runnable example binaries that depend on the library.

## Building and testing

```bash
make                # build (warnings are errors)
make test           # unit tests bundled by tests/unit (workspace --lib)
make fmt            # format code
make clean          # remove build artifacts
make update         # update dependencies
make hooks          # install Claude Code hooks
```

## Integration tests

> Configure an LLM provider first (see [Environment](#environment)).

```bash
make test_integration                     # run all
make test_integration name=bash_usage     # run one
```

## Use cases

```bash
make use_case                                                 # list available
make use_case name=terminal-repl                              # run one
make use_case name=deep-research args="What is a good life?"  # with arguments
```

```bash
make bump                  # bump patch version, run tests, commit, tag
make bump part=minor       # bump minor version
make bump part=major       # bump major version
```

GitHub Actions handles the crates.io publish via trusted publishing once the new tag is pushed (`git push --tags`).

## Documentation

```bash
make doc                   # cargo doc --no-deps -p agentwerk (strict rustdoc)
```

## LiteLLM proxy

Start a local LiteLLM proxy on port 4000 that forwards to a provider. Requires Docker.

```bash
make litellm                               # default: anthropic
make litellm LITELLM_PROVIDER=openai       # use OpenAI
make litellm LITELLM_PROVIDER=mistral      # use Mistral
```

## Local inference servers

agentwerk relies on server-side tool calling. Enable it through the following flags:

| Server | Flag |
|---|---|
| vLLM | `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser <parser>` |
| llama.cpp | `--jinja` (enables tool calling) |
