Read or write pages in the shared knowledge base: durable facts injected into every ticket's system prompt. Existing pages' one-line summaries appear under `## Knowledge`; no such section means the store is empty. `write` upserts a whole page, `read` loads one body, `list` shows the index.

- Save a durable fact future tickets need; one topic per page, with a descriptive slug (`deployment-config`, `pkg-utils-py`).
- `summary` is a one-sentence index line under 80 chars. Cross-link pages with `[[slug]]`.
- `write` overwrites the page and requires `slug`, `summary`, and `content`: omitting any is the most common error. Read first if you mean to append.
- Only `read` a slug already shown in `## Knowledge` or `list`; an unseen slug does not exist.

## When NOT to use

- Task progress or TODOs: those belong on tickets.
- A new page per tiny fact: consolidate related facts.
