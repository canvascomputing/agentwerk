---
name: bash_tool
read_only: false
---

Execute a shell command via `sh -c` in the working directory and return its trimmed stdout and stderr. The tool is registered with a glob pattern; a non-matching command is rejected and nothing runs.

- One command family per registration (e.g. `git *`); the pattern and read-only status are operator choices, not the model's.
- Default timeout is 120 000 ms; request up to 600 000 ms via `timeout_ms`.
- Treat as destructive by default: side effects depend on the registered pattern (`git status` is read-only, `git push` is not).

## When NOT to use

- Read a file: `read_file_tool`. List a directory: `list_directory_tool`. Find files by name: `glob_tool`. Search contents: `grep_tool`. Edit a file: `edit_file_tool` / `write_file_tool`.
- Never run `grep`, `rg`, `find`, `ls`, `cat`, or `sed` here: the dedicated tools are faster, structured, and cite line numbers.
