name: edit_file_tool
read_only: false
---

Replace one or more occurrences of a string inside an existing file, preserving the rest byte-for-byte. `old_string` must match exactly, including indentation and whitespace. Returns how many occurrences were replaced.

- ALWAYS `read_file_tool` first; otherwise `old_string` is a guess, likely absent or ambiguous.
- Default mode replaces one occurrence and fails if `old_string` is not unique: widen it with surrounding context or set `replace_all`. It also fails when `old_string` is not found at all.
- The overwrite is in place; recovery needs version control or a prior backup. `path` resolves against the working directory.

## When NOT to use

- Create a new file or fully rewrite one: use `write_file_tool`.

  "properties": {
    "path": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Path to the file to edit, relative to the working directory."
    },
    "old_string": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Exact text to find. Must appear verbatim in the file, including indentation and trailing whitespace."
    },
    "new_string": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Replacement text. May be empty to delete the match."
    },
    "replace_all": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Replace every occurrence (default: false). When false, the tool fails if `old_string` matches more than once."
    }
