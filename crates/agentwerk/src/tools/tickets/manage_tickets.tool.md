name: manage_tickets_tool
read_only: false
---

Read and mutate the ticket queue from one tool: `get` / `list` / `search` to read, `create` / `edit` to write. One `action` per call; a `key` defaults to your current ticket when omitted, and `create` stamps `reporter` from the calling agent. `list` and `search` cap at 50 tickets.

- This tool cannot transition status: finish with `finish_ticket` (`Failed` is reserved for system outcomes like a schema-retry trip or policy violation).
- ALWAYS finish your current ticket with `finish_ticket` before the response ends, or it stays `InProgress` and the loop re-picks it.

## When NOT to use

- Reads only: register `read_tickets_tool` (smaller surface, fewer mistakes); write-only: register `write_tickets_tool` to block listing.
- Finish your current ticket: call `finish_ticket`.
- Find code or files: use `grep_tool` / `glob_tool`.
