name: handover_ticket
read_only: false

Finish the current ticket and hand follow-up work to another agent in one atomic call: it writes this ticket's `result`, marks it `Finished` (terminal), and creates a `Todo` child pinned to `to` with this ticket as its `parent`. This is the only way to finish-and-chain in one turn.

- Operates on your current ticket; there is no `key` parameter. Call once, when the work is done and the next turn belongs to another agent.
- `to` labels the child: an agent name pins it to that agent, a scope label routes it to any agent in that scope.
- `result` is a non-empty plain-text summary of your work (`null` or empty is rejected); `task` is the child's plain-text instruction.
- An optional `schema` rides along to the child, whose result must then validate against it. A schema failure on your own `result` counts toward `max_schema_retries`, and the child is NOT created.

## When NOT to use

- Record a result with no follow-up: call `finish_ticket`.
- Create or edit tickets without finishing this one: call `manage_tickets_tool`.
