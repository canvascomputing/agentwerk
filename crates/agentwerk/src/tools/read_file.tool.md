name: read_file_tool
read_only: true
---

Read a file's contents, returning line-numbered text so you can cite `file:line` and target edits. Output is `<line_no>\t<line>` from line 1; the path resolves against the working directory.

- For large files, pass `offset` and `limit` to read only the slice you need.
- To read around a `grep_tool` hit, set `col_offset`/`col_limit` (e.g. `col_offset = grep_col - 50`); output then becomes `<line_no>:<col>\t<slice>`.
- A directory `path` returns its entries instead of file lines: read one of them next.
- ALWAYS read a file before editing it; `edit_file_tool` refuses otherwise.

## When NOT to use

- List a directory: use `list_directory_tool`.
- Find files by name: use `glob_tool`.
- Search many files: use `grep_tool`.

  "properties": {
    "path": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Path to the file to read."
    },

    },
    "limit": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Number of lines to read (default: to end of file). Combine with `offset` to read a slice."
    },
    "col_offset": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "1-based byte offset within each line to start reading from (default: full line). Compatible with the column reported by `grep_tool` in content mode. To see context around a match, subtract a margin (e.g. `col_offset = grep_column - 50`)."
    },
    "col_limit": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Max bytes to read per line from `col_offset` (default: to end of line)."
