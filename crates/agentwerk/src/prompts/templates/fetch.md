<!-- What `fetch` says about an address it will not fetch or could not read. -->

## fetch_too_long
`url` is {{ length }} characters, over the {{ limit }} character limit. Fetch one page rather than a long generated address.

## fetch_scheme_missing
`url` names no scheme. Write the full address, starting with https://.

## fetch_scheme_unsupported
Scheme `{{ scheme }}` cannot be fetched. Use http or https.

## fetch_credentials_present
`url` carries embedded credentials, which are never sent. Remove the part before the @.

## fetch_host_missing
`url` names no host. Write the full address, such as https://example.com/page.

## fetch_host_not_resolvable
`{{ host }}` is not a publicly resolvable host name. Fetch a public address instead.

## fetch_too_many_redirects
The address redirected more than {{ limit }} times and was not followed further. Fetch the final address directly.

## fetch_request_failed
The request failed: {{ error }}. Check the address, or fetch a different one.

## fetch_body_not_read
The response body could not be read: {{ error }}. Fetch the address again, or another one.

## fetch_response_too_large
The response is {{ bytes }} bytes, over the {{ limit }} byte limit, and was not read. Fetch a smaller page.

## fetch_redirect_location_missing
The address redirected without a Location header, so there is nowhere to follow. Fetch the final address directly.
