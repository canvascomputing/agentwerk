<!-- What the file tools say when a path, a match, or a write does not hold. The `path_hint_*` entries close a not-found message. -->

## edit_file_read_failed
{{ path }} could not be read: {{ error }}. Check the path with `list_directory` before editing it.

## edit_file_old_string_not_found
No `old_string` match in {{ path }}. Read the file and copy the text exactly, including indentation, because `edit_file` matches byte for byte.

`old_string` matches {{ count }} places in {{ path }}. Extend it with the surrounding lines until it is unique, or set `replace_all` to true to change every one.
