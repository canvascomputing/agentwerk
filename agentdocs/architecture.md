# Architecture

The invariants that shape how code fits together. Layout says where code lives; this file says why the seams are where they are.

## Builder, system, loop

**A run has three stages: build the `Agent`, bind it to a `TicketSystem`, drive the system with `run` (long-lived) or `run_dry` (drain the fixed batch).**

- The `Agent` builder carries identity, prompt parts, provider/model, tools, working dir, event handler, and a `Weak<TicketSystem>` (dangling by default).
- `TicketSystem::add(agent)` (or `agent.ticket_system(&shared)`) stamps the system's `Weak<Self>` onto the agent, drains any tickets the agent had queued in its private default system into the shared one, and pushes a clone of the agent onto the system's agents list.
- `TicketSystem::run` / `run_dry` spawn one tokio task per registered agent; each task upgrades its `Weak` once at the start and reads the shared store, policies, stats, and interrupt signal from the resulting `Arc<TicketSystem>`.

## Shared system, per-agent task

**Agents read shared state through one `Arc<TicketSystem>`. Locks are held only around queue and metric operations, never across `provider.respond().await`.**

- The ticket store, policies, stats, interrupt signal, and registered-agent list live on `TicketSystem`.
- The per-agent loop in `agents/loop.rs` claims one ticket, drives it through one or more provider/tool steps, and releases locks before each await.
- Multiple agents share one queue; a ticket is claimed exactly once.
- Sub-systems are not nested: a single `TicketSystem` is the unit of orchestration.

## Path A and Path B routing

**Tickets reach agents either by direct assignment (Path A) or by label scope (Path B).**

- A ticket built with `Ticket::new(...).assign_to(name)` is born `Status::InProgress` and pinned to the named agent; only that agent can pick it up.
- A ticket built with `.label(...)` (or via `task_labeled(value, label)`) is `Status::Todo` and picked up by any agent whose `label` scope intersects.
- An agent with empty labels handles only tickets with no labels; that is the "default scope".
- The system never auto-resolves a name against the registered-agent set: callers know which routing path they want.

## Finishing is a tool call

**Agents finish tickets by calling `write_result_tool` with a `result` (a non-empty string for tickets without a schema, or a JSON value for schema-bound tickets). The framework owns the lifecycle stamps and transitions the ticket to `Done`.**

- `Status` transitions go through tickets-side helpers; the agent never writes status directly. `Failed` is reserved for system-driven outcomes (schema-retry trip, policy violations).
- `task_schema*` attaches a `Schema` to the ticket; the tool validates the result and the loop applies `max_schema_retries` on mismatch.
- A successful call appends one NDJSON record `{agent, ticket, result}` to `<dir>/results.jsonl` (configured via `TicketSystem::dir(d)`; falls back to the agent's directory) and attaches the same `ResultRecord` to the ticket. The record is surfaced through `Ticket::result()`; `run_dry` returns its serialized form for the most recent `Done` ticket.
- When a directory is set, the system also appends one JSON line to `<dir>/tickets.jsonl` per lifecycle event (`created`, `started`, `done`, `failed`). The log is observational: errors are swallowed and an unset directory skips writes entirely. The result payload stays in `results.jsonl`; `tickets.jsonl` carries only the transition.

## Knowledge is opt-in and shareable across agents

**An agent can carry durable facts across every ticket it handles via `Agent::knowledge(&store)`, including across separate `run` / `run_dry` calls and across process restarts. Off by default; each ticket starts without a knowledge section.**

Two layers of state exist. The intra-ticket message vector inside `process_ticket` is always present; it carries a multi-step tool turn through and is dropped when the ticket reaches a terminal status. `Agent::knowledge(&store)` adds a separate cross-ticket layer: a `Knowledge` store rooted at a caller-supplied directory, surfaced to the model through `KnowledgeTool` and rendered into the system prompt under `## Knowledge`.

- The store is constructed via `Knowledge::open(knowledge_dir)` and passed to one or more agents through `Agent::knowledge(&store)`. Two agents bound to the same `Arc<Knowledge>` share the same `index.md` and `pages/` directory; two agents bound to different stores see independent knowledge. The pattern mirrors `Agent::ticket_system(&Arc<TicketSystem>)`. Pointing `Knowledge::open` at the same directory as `TicketSystem::dir` co-locates knowledge pages with `results.jsonl` and `tickets.jsonl`.
- The store uses a page-based layout: `<dir>/index.md` holds one-line summaries, and `<dir>/pages/<slug>.md` holds full page content with frontmatter. Only the compact index is injected into the system prompt; the agent reads full pages on demand via the `read` action.
- The loop reads `Knowledge::index()` once at the top of `process_ticket` and feeds the result to `Agent::system_prompt(knowledge: Option<&str>)`. The system prompt stays byte-stable across every turn of the ticket so the provider's prefix cache survives mid-ticket knowledge writes; cross-ticket and cross-agent writes become visible at the top of the next ticket.
- Knowledge is purely model-driven. The model calls `knowledge_tool` with `write` / `read` / `remove` / `list`; the tool description carries the policy (durable facts only, do NOT save task progress / TODOs). A hard char limit (default 4000) on the index rejects writes that would push the rendered prompt section past the cap and tells the model to consolidate first.

## One observer, one error path

**`Event` reports state. `ProviderError` and `ToolError` report failed contracts. The two channels carry independent information.**

- State transitions exist only as `Event` (`TicketClaimed`, `TicketFinished`, `RequestStarted`, `RequestFinished`, `TextChunkReceived`, `TokensReported`).
- An observable failure fires both the typed error (`ProviderError`, `ToolError`) and a matching `Event` (`RequestFailed`, `ToolCallFailed`, `PolicyViolated`).
- A model-fixable failure (wrong arguments, schema mismatch, missing file) goes back to the model as a `ToolResult::Error` content block; it still fires `ToolCallFailed` but does not stop the run.
- Handlers MUST be cheap, non-blocking closures; the loop does not await them.

## New observables pick a channel

**Each new signal goes on `Event`, on a typed error, or on both. Pick by what the signal describes.**

- Reached a state: `Event` only.
- Could not fulfil a contract: typed error in the matching domain.
- Both at once (terminal request failure, policy trip): define both. Share the payload type when observer-friendly (`PolicyKind`); introduce a stripped `Kind` enum when the error carries observer-hostile detail (`RequestErrorKind`, `ToolFailureKind`).
- Model-fixable failure: `ToolResult::Error(String)`; still fires `ToolCallFailed` but is recoverable.

## Providers own their client

**Each concrete provider owns a `reqwest::Client` directly. There is no transport abstraction.**

- The `Provider` trait fulfils one contract: `respond` (drive one step) plus per-vendor metadata.
- `ModelRequest`, `Message`, `ContentBlock`, and `TokenUsage` are the wire-shaped types every provider converts to and from.
- HTTP error mapping is shared through `providers::map_http_errors` plus a provider-specific `classify` closure; SSE parsing lives in `providers::stream`.
- Retry happens at the request level using `Policies::max_request_retries` and `request_retry_delay`; vendor code does not retry.

## Cancellation is cooperative

**A run is cancelled by setting one shared `Arc<AtomicBool>`. Every waiter polls it.**

- The signal lives behind `TicketSystem::interrupt_signal`; each agent's loop reads it via the upgraded `Arc<TicketSystem>`.
- Tools observe it through `ToolContext::interrupt_signal` and `wait_for_cancel`; pair with `tokio::select!` so cancel drops the losing branch promptly.
- Dropping the `TicketSystem` while agents still reference it via `Weak` is the public way to abort: the upgrade fails and each task panics out cleanly.

## Stats are per-system, write-only-by-domain

**`Stats` is one struct of atomic counters; each domain interacts through its own write-only protocol.**

- `LoopStats` is what the per-agent loop sees: `record_step`, `record_request`, `record_tool_call`, `record_error`.
- `TicketStats` is what the ticket lifecycle sees: `record_created`, `record_started`, `record_done`, `record_failed`.
- Reads happen on `Stats` directly through inherent accessors (`steps()`, `tickets_done()`, `run_duration()`, `success_rate()`, ...), never through the recorder traits.
- Lock-free for increments; readers do one atomic load per call.
- `Stats::stats_for_label(label)` returns a nested `Stats` slice scoped to one label. The loop and ticket lifecycle bump each slice alongside the global counters; `run_duration()` is `None` on a slice (elapsed run duration stays global).

## Policies are per-system, checked at step boundaries

**A run stops cleanly when any limit on `Policies` trips. The check fires `EventKind::PolicyViolated` and exits the per-agent task.**

- The loop calls `policy_violated_kind` at each iteration; a non-`None` return walks the agent off the queue.
- Token budgets read from `Stats`; `max_time` reads from `Policies` and is checked separately by the `run_dry` watcher (graceful stop, not a `PolicyViolated` event).
- Schema-retry budget is applied per-ticket inside the result-writing path, not at the top of the loop.
