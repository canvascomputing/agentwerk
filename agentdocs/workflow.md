# Workflow

Commands used to build, test, release, and run example agents.

## Build

**Every build MUST run with `-D warnings`.**

- `make` compiles the crate.
- `make fmt` formats the code.
- `make clean` removes build artefacts.
- Any warning fails the build.

## Test

**Test layout and writing rules live in [testing.md](testing.md).**

- `make test` runs `cargo test --workspace --lib` (every crate's inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`).
- `make test_integration` runs the live-provider tests bundled by `tests/integration.rs`.

## Integration env

**Integration tests read provider config from a `.env` file at the repo root.**

- `make test_integration` sources `.env` automatically when present.
- The file holds shell `export` statements, one per variable:
  ```
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-local
  export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8095
  ```
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` points at a local OpenAI-compatible proxy on port 8095.
- `.env` is gitignored: each contributor maintains their own.

## Release

**`make bump` runs the full release step in one command.**

- `make bump` runs tests, bumps the patch version, commits, and tags.
- `make bump part=minor` bumps the minor version.
- `make bump part=major` bumps the major version.
- Push the new tag with `git push --tags`.

## Hooks

**`make hooks` installs Claude Code hooks into `.claude/settings.local.json`.**

- Source files live in `hooks/` (tracked). `make hooks` copies them into `.claude/hooks/` (ignored) and merges the config.
- `check-conventions.sh` injects `agentdocs/style.md` and `agentdocs/architecture.md` as context after each Rust file edit.
## Use cases

**Example agents live in a separate crate and run through `make use_case`.**

- Source is in `crates/use-cases/src/`.
- Run an example with `make use_case name=<name>`.
- `terminal-repl` is a per-turn interactive chat that prints output as it arrives.
- `divide-and-conquer` partitions an arithmetic problem across agents sharing one ticket queue.
- `deep-research` is a two-phase research pipeline with web search (requires `BRAVE_API_KEY`).
